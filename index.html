        <h2>Capability Statement: Dragon Byte</h2>
        <div class="capability-statement-content">
            <h3>Empowering Papua New Guinea through Secure, Mobile-First Digital Transformation</h3>
            
            <h4>Company Overview</h4>
            <p>Dragon Byte is a 100% Papua New Guinean-owned IT consultancy founded in 2025. We specialize in modernizing organizations through DevSecOps and Laravel-based development. We bridge the gap between global security standards and the local PNG context, delivering software that is high-performing, secure, and user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h4>Core Competencies</h4>
            <ul class="profile-list">
                <li><strong>DevSecOps & Secure Software Development:</strong> Integrating security into every phase of the development lifecycle using the Laravel framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile-First Solutions:</strong> Engineering lightweight, high-performance applications optimized for PNG's mobile network constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Centric UI/UX Design:</strong> Creating "friendly" and intuitive interfaces that ensure high adoption rates for users of all technical levels.</li>
                <li><strong>IT Strategy & Digital Transformation:</strong> Helping NGOs and government agencies transition from manual processes to secure digital workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems Integration:</strong> Connecting disparate tools into a unified, secure ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Differentiators</h4>
            <ul class="profile-list">
                <li><strong>The DevSecOps Edge:</strong> Unlike firms that treat security as an afterthought, we use automated security testing and encrypted-by-default code to protect sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Laravel Specialization:</strong> We utilize the world's leading PHP framework to provide enterprise-grade stability without the high licensing costs of proprietary software.</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous Insight:</strong> Founded by digital natives, we understand the unique challenges of connectivity and digital literacy across PNG's provinces.</li>
                <li><strong>Agile & Cost-Effective:</strong> As a modern, streamlined consultancy, we deliver high-end results faster and with more transparency than legacy IT providers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Past Performance / Representative Project</h4>
            <p>As part of their undergraduate studies, the co-owners of Dragon Byte completed multiple academic and applied technology projects focused on secure systems development, database design, web application deployment, and user-centered interface design.</p>
            <p>These projects involved practical implementation of modern development methodologies, including secure coding principles, system integration, and mobile-responsive application development.</p>
            <p>The experience gained through these undergraduate initiatives forms the technical foundation of Dragon Byte's current DevSecOps-oriented IT consultancy approach.</p>

<div id="technical-capabilities-modal" class="technical-capabilities-overlay">
    <div class="technical-capabilities-window">
        <button class="close-btn" onclick="closeTechnicalCapabilities()">&times;</button>
        <h2>Technical Capabilities: The Laravel Powerhouse</h2>
        <div class="technical-capabilities-content">
            <h3>Built-in DevSecOps Excellence</h3>
            <p>At Dragon Byte, we use Laravel as our primary framework because it is "secure by design." In the Papua New Guinea market, where data privacy is becoming a critical concern for NGOs and government bodies, Laravel provides enterprise-grade protection right out of the box.</p>
            
            <ul class="profile-list">
                <li><strong>Integrated Defense:</strong> Laravel automatically shields your systems against the most common web threats, such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means your client data is protected without needing expensive, bulky third-party security add-ons.</li>
                <li><strong>Military-Grade Encryption:</strong> Every piece of sensitive information—from passwords to personal IDs—is hashed using industry-leading algorithms like Bcrypt and Argon2.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Access Control:</strong> We implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and secure session management as standard features, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive records.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mobile-First Performance</h3>
            <p>In PNG, mobile accessibility is the priority. We leverage Laravel's efficient architecture to build backends that are specifically optimized for the local environment.</p>
            
            <ul class="profile-list">
                <li><strong>Low-Bandwidth Efficiency:</strong> We use an API-first approach to ensure that only the most essential data is transmitted. This allows your applications to load quickly and reliably, even on 3G connections in remote provinces.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Speed Response:</strong> By utilizing Laravel's advanced caching systems, we reduce server strain, making the user experience feel "snappy" and responsive on budget-friendly smartphones.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data:</strong> Whether it is a logistics tracker or a live project update for a non-profit, we provide real-time information flow without requiring constant page refreshes, saving users' mobile data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Friendly UI/UX: The "Clean Code" Advantage</h3>
            <p>Because Laravel follows a structured Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, we can keep the complex "brain" of the application separate from the "face" (the UI).</p>
            
            <ul class="profile-list">
                <li><strong>Seamless Interaction:</strong> We pair Laravel with modern tools like Livewire or Tailwind CSS to create smooth, interactive interfaces. These feel like high-end mobile apps but run efficiently in any web browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency & Clarity:</strong> Our use of the Blade templating engine ensures that every button, font, and menu is consistent across the entire platform. This makes the software friendly and intuitive for users, regardless of their technical background.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Laravel is the Strategic Choice for PNG</h3>
            <p>By choosing a Laravel-based solution from Dragon Byte, you avoid the high licensing fees of proprietary software. As an open-source framework with global support, it offers unmatched scalability: your system can start as a small internal tool and grow to serve the entire nation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Laravel's clean, standardized structure means your investment is future-proof. The code is easy to maintain and update, ensuring that your digital infrastructure remains secure and modern for years to come.</p>
